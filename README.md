## LM Syntactic Generalization

### Getting Started
Set up a Python virtual environment and download the lm-zoo package(https://github.com/cpllab/lm-zoo). Eventually we'll have to call our own versions of the Gulordava RNN (and hopefully GPT2), but this is a good start.

```
ENV_NAME=
python3 -m virtualenv $ENV_NAME
source $ENV_NAME/bin/activate
pip install lm-zoo
```
